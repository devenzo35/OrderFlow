# Product Definition: OrderFlow

This document outlines the product vision, user stories, and business rules for the OrderFlow application. It serves as a guide for development to ensure we are building the right product for the right people.

## 1. Product Vision

*The product vision is the "why" behind your project. It's a short, aspirational statement that describes the ultimate goal.*

**Our vision for OrderFlow is:**

> (Example: To provide small businesses with the simplest, most intuitive platform for managing and analyzing their inventory and financial movements.)

## 2. User Stories

*User stories describe what a user wants to do and why. They follow the format: "As a [type of user], I want to [perform some action] so that I can [achieve some goal]."*

### User Roles

*   **Administrator:** Manages users and has full system access.
*   **Standard User:** Manages their own data within the system.

### Key User Stories

*   **As an administrator, I want to create, view, and manage user accounts so that my team can access the system.**
*   **As a user, I want to securely log in to the system so that my data remains private.**
*   **As a user, I want to record a new financial movement (e.g., an expense or income) so that I can keep my records up to date.**
*   **As a user, I want to assign a category to each movement so that I can organize and analyze my financial data.**
*   **As a user, I want to view a list of all my past movements so that I can review my history.**
*   **As a user, I want to generate a monthly financial report so that I can get a summary of my income and expenses.**
*   **(Add more user stories here)**

## 3. Business Rules

*Business rules are the specific, concrete constraints and logic that the system must follow. They are derived from the user stories.*

### General Rules

*   A user's email address must be unique.
*   A user's password must be securely hashed and stored.

### Movement Management

*   A movement must have a date, a description, and an amount.
*   The movement amount must be a positive number (the type, e.g., "income" or "expense", will determine its effect).
*   A movement must be assigned to an existing category.
*   A user can only create, view, edit, or delete their own movements.
*   An administrator can view or edit any user's movements.

### Category Management

*   A category must have a unique name.
*   Default categories (e.g., "Uncategorized", "Salary", "Groceries") should be created for new users.

### Reporting

*   Reports can be generated for specific date ranges (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
*   Reports should summarize movements by category.
